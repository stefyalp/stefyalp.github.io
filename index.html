            <p>Hey there! I’m Stefania, a tech enthusiast with a mix of hobbies that keep life exciting.</p>
            <p>I’m really into strategy games like TFT, Chess, and Civilization. Outside of gaming and coding, you’ll often find me working on a woodworking project, planning my next trip, or volunteering at a local animal shelter on weekends.</p>
            <p>I’m a big dog lover, so spending time with the shelter animals is incredibly rewarding.</p>

        <section class="travel">
            <p>Traveling is another passion, and I’m even learning Japanese to connect more with the culture. I love exploring new places and getting immersed in different cultures.</p>

        <section class="learning">
            <p>Right now, I’m also diving into AWS Cloud skills—it’s part of my journey to keep expanding what I know.</p>
            <p>When I get some downtime, I relax with anime or get outdoors. Whether it’s gaming, coding, or just trying something new, I’m always up for learning and growing.</p>
