            <p>Hey there! I’m Stefania, a tech enthusiast with a mix of hobbies that keep life exciting.</p>
            <p>I’m really into strategy games like TFT, Chess, and Civilization. Outside of gaming and coding, you’ll often find me working on a woodworking project, planning my next trip, or volunteering at a local animal shelter on weekends.</p>
            <p>I’m a big dog lover, so spending time with the shelter animals is incredibly rewarding.</p>
