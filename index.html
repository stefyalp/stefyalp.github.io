Hey there! I’m Stefania
I'm a tech enthusiast with a mix of hobbies that keep life exciting.
            
 I’m really into strategy games like TFT, Chess, and Civilization—
 Outside of gaming and coding, you’ll often find me working on a woodworking project,
planning my next trip, or volunteering at a local animal shelter on weekends.
            
I’m a big dog lover, so spending time with the shelter animals is incredibly rewarding.
            
Traveling is another passion, and I’m even learning Japanese to connect more with the culture.

        </div>

        <p>
            
Right now, I’m also diving into AWS Cloud skills—it’s part of my journey to keep expanding what I know.
            
When I get some downtime, I relax with anime or get outdoors.
Whether it’s gaming, coding, or just trying something new, I’m always up for learning and growing....</p>
